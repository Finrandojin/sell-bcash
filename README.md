This guide assumes you had Bitcoins in possesion prior the hard fork, and you know your private key for those Bitcoins.

## Step 1 - Secure your Bitcoins

***why?***

To make sure your Bitcoins don't get lost or stolen, you will need to move them to a new wallet. To cash out your BCash you're going to have to install a BCash only which we can't trust completely yet, and possibly expose your private keys. By moving your Bitcoins to a new address, you're removing that risk. Simply put, you're going to empty both Bitcoin and BCash from the old address.


***how?***

If you're using a wallet like Electrum, *you must create a new seed*, keep it safe and don't share it with anyone. Once you have your new wallet up, send your bitcoins to the new wallet.

If all you have is a private key, you can accomplish this is via the supported wallets [listed here](http://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet). For example, in the [blockchain wallet](http://blockchain.info/wallet), you should create an account, go to *Settings*, *Addresses*, and then *Import Addresses*. Paste your private key, and you'll then be able to *Spend* the address balance to a new one of your choice.


## Step 2 - Install a BCash wallet and import your old Bitcoin address

***why?***

To send your BCash to an exchange you'll have to use a wallet of the BCash network. You cannot do that with a Bitcoin-only wallet.


***how?***

Support for BCash isn't huge. The most obvious way to do this currently is with [Electrum Cash](http://electroncash.org/). Note that Electrum Cash has nothing to do with the real Electrum, and we cannot trust this app fully - it *may steal your Bitcoins*. It is advised to run it in a [Virtual Machine](https://www.howtogeek.com/196060/beginner-geek-how-to-create-and-use-virtual-machines/). 

Once you install the wallet, import your old Bitcoin address with the private key. The wallet might show the Bitcoin transaction to the new address (a bug?) but you should still be able to spend your BCash.

## Step 3 - Send the BCash to an exchange of your choice

***why?***

There's no magic that transforms BCash into Bitcoin. You'll need to sell it in an exchange site.


***how?***

Sadly, BCash deposits are still not available at the exchange sites. Once they become available, we'll continue this guide.

BCash mining is currenly really slow, with many hours between each mined block. Only after a difficulty adjustment, the network will be usable.


## Step 4 - Sell the BCash for Bitcoins

## Step 5 - Withdraw your free Bitcoins to your new Bitcoin address
